This is the central cluster where all downstream clusters send their metrics to. Deployed in this cluster are the following components:   Opni Gateway   Cortex   Grafana   Etcd   (optional) Opni Agent   Downstream Clusters  Downstream clusters are the clusters that send their metrics to the Opni Monitoring cluster. Deployed in these clusters are the following components:   Opni Agent   Prometheus Agent   OpenID Provider  A production deployment of Opni Monitoring must use an OpenID Provider to authenticate users. The Grafana dashboard deployed in the Opni Monitoring cluster will be configured to use the OpenID Provider for user login. Support for other authentication mechanisms (LDAP, SAML, etc.) may be added in the future. Long-Term Storage  A production deployment of Opni Monitoring should be configured to use long-term metric storage. For example, this could be an S3-compatible object storage service.

Metrics from all clusters are sent to the Opni Gateway in this cluster, and are processed and stored by Cortex.\nDownstream Cluster This refers to a cluster running the Opni Agent and Prometheus Agent which sends all its metrics (using Prometheus Remote-Write) to the main cluster.\nNote The Opni Agent and Prometheus Agent are often also installed into the main cluster, to scrape metrics from the Opni Gateway and Cortex. However, we would still refer to that cluster as the main cluster.

This setup is not production-ready. If that is what you are looking for, check out the full Installation guide.\nImportant Before proceeding, please read the section on Terminology to familiarize yourself with a few key terms.  Prerequisites Infrastructure   One main cluster where the Opni Monitoring control-plane components will be installed.\n The main cluster must be accessible to all downstream clusters from a persistent DNS name. For demo purposes, you can use sslip.io if you do not have a domain name available.    One or more downstream clusters which will be configured to send metrics to the main cluster\n  All clusters must have a default storage class available.\n  Dependencies   Install helmfile using your distribution’s package manager or from the GitHub release page.\n  Clone the opni-monitoring repo:\n$ git clone https://github.com/rancher/opni-monitoring   Setting up the main cluster DNS Configuration  Identify the DNS name of your main cluster. This will be referenced in the following sections as \u003cgateway_address\u003e. Configure A records such that \u003cgateway_address\u003e and grafana.\u003cgateway_address\u003e both route to the IP address of your main cluster’s load balancer (skip this step if you are using sslip.io or a similar service).  Chart configuration Inside the opni-monitoring repo, change directories to deploy/charts/opni-monitoring/custom. There are three template files in this directory which you will need to copy and edit before continuing.\n Copy cortex-template.yaml to cortex.yaml and leave it empty. Copy grafana-template.yaml to grafana.yaml and edit it as follows, substituting \u003cgateway_address\u003e:  grafana.ini:server:domain:\"grafana.\u003cgateway_address\u003e\"root_url:\"https://\u003cgateway_address\u003e\"auth.generic_oauth:client_id:\"grafana\"client_secret:\"supersecret\"# (this can be whatever you want)auth_url:\"http://\u003cgateway_address\u003e:4000/oauth2/authorize\"token_url:\"http://\u003cgateway_address\u003e:4000/oauth2/token\"api_url:\"http://\u003cgateway_address\u003e:4000/oauth2/userinfo\"allowed_domains:example.com# (this can be whatever you want, but remember it for later)role_attribute_path:grafana_roleuse_pkce:falsetls:- secretName:grafana-tls-keyshosts:- \"grafana.\u003cgateway_address\u003e\"ingress:enabled:truehosts:- \"grafana.\u003cgateway_address\u003e\"Copy opni-monitoring-template.yaml to opni-monitoring.yaml and edit it as follows, substituting \u003cgateway_address\u003e:  auth:provider:noauthnoauth:discovery:issuer:\"http://\u003cgateway_address\u003e:4000/oauth2\"clientID:grafanaclientSecret:supersecret# (this must match client_secret in grafana.yaml)redirectURI:\"https://grafana.\u003cgateway_address\u003e/login/generic_oauth\"managementAPIEndpoint:\"opni-monitoring-internal:11090\"port:4000gateway:hostname:\"\u003cgateway_address\u003e\"dnsNames:- \"\u003cgateway_address\u003e\"Chart Installation Inside the opni-monitoring repo, change directories to deploy/.\n Ensure your current kubeconfig points to the main cluster. Run helmfile apply Wait for all resources to become ready. This may take a few minutes.  Accessing the dashboard Once all the pods in the opni-monitoring namespace are running, open the web dashboard:\n Port-forward to the opni-monitoring-internal service:  kubectl -n opni-monitoring port-forward svc/opni-monitoring-internal management-web:management-web Open your browser to http://localhost:12080.  Adding a cluster First, let’s add the main cluster itself - this allows us to gather metrics from the Opni Gateway and Cortex. Follow these steps to add the cluster to Opni Monitoring:\nCreate a token Tokens are used to authenticate new clusters during the bootstrap process. To create one:\n Navigate to the Tokens tab in the sidebar Click Create Token Use the default fields, and click Create. The new token will appear in the table.  Token Expiration All tokens will expire after a certain amount of time. The default value is 10 minutes, but you can choose any duration you like. If your token expires, you can simply create a new one.  Add a cluster   Navigate to the Clusters tab in the sidebar\n  Click Add Cluster\n  In the Capabilities drop-down menu, select metrics\n  In the Token drop-down menu, select the token we just created. When a capability and token have been selected, an install command will appear below.\n  Check the box that says Install Prometheus Operator (however, if you already have Prometheus Operator installed on a cluster you want to add, leave it unchecked).\n  Click on the install command to copy it to the clipboard\n  In a terminal, ensure your KUBECONFIG environment variable or ~/.kube/config context points to the main cluster, then paste and run the command.\n  In a few seconds, you should see a green banner informing you that the cluster has been added. Click Finish to return to the cluster list.\n  Repeat the above steps for any additional clusters you want to add.\n  Next Steps Read the section on Access Control to learn how to configure roles and role bindings. Then, head to https://grafana.\u003cgateway_address\u003e in your browser to sign in.\nDemo Authentication With the demo setup, there is no authentication - when signing in to Grafana, you will instead be presented with a list of all known users in the system (the set of all subjects in the current list of role bindings) and can choose any user to view metrics from the perspective of that user.  Check out the Guides section for more.
